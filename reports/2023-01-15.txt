	- Started researching and looking into debugging for the algorithm.

Antonia:

This week:
	- in PieceMovement.cpp: implemented functiosn to detect blunders (to detect if we can eat any piece after the last opponent's moveÂ°. Since in closed positions no one should be able to take opponent pieces, if we suddenly can eat a piece it means that the opponent played badly).
	- in WeakPawns.cpp : implemented some more weak pawns functions for the needs of the 2-person dfs

Next week:
	- Fix bugs and merge
	- start thinking about the presentation
