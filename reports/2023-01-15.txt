Aarrya:
  This week:
    spent more time refining the algorithm idea and finalised it to a rough version of an alpha beta pruning
    wrote the code and almost completed it
  Next week:
    put everything together, debug, test, pray to god


Etienne:
This week:
	- Continued working on the Unit-Tests and almost finished them.
	- Started researching and looking into debugging for the algorithm.
Next week:
	- Finish all the Unit-Tests, debug and finish the algorithm.


Antonia:

This week:
	- in PieceMovement.cpp: implemented functiosn to detect blunders (to detect if we can eat any piece after the last opponent's moveÂ°. Since in closed positions no one should be able to take opponent pieces, if we suddenly can eat a piece it means that the opponent played badly).
	- in WeakPawns.cpp : implemented some more weak pawns functions for the needs of the 2-person dfs

Next week:
	- Fix bugs and merge
	- start thinking about the presentation


Ariel:
This week: 
	  - Coded test functions for CFBoard.cpp
Next week:
	  - Continue writing test functions
	  - Continue working with the switch team to train the AI
	  - Help Merge the project


Ba Cong:
This week:
	- Fixed the one person dfs when it goes to an infinite loop too early.
	- Optimized the one person dfs for higher depth.
	- Discovered bugs in naiveCheckCheck and CFBoard from testing with one person dfs, informed Sirawit and Yoshi to fix them afterwards.
Next week:
	- Finish the one person dfs and help out on other algorithms.
	- Help with building connectors between components of the project.
