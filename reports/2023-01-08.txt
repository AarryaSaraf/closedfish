Ariel:
This week: 
          - Met with the switch team to run tests on the AI using the generator code.
	  - Looked into how to create test functions
	  - Started coding test functions for CFBoard.cpp
Next week:
	  - Continue writing test functions
	  - Continue working with the switch team to train the AI

Ba Cong:
This week:
	- Implement one-person DFS algorithm by moving towards positions closest to the heat map
	- Use the algorithm class provided by Rali to set up an architecture for communication between components of the project.
Next week:
	- Tweak the one-person DFS algorithm for better performance
	- Help the team doing two-people DFS algorithm

Etienne:
This week:
	- Continued working on and implementing the unit-tests for our algorithm.
	- Had more meetings with the members of the algorithm team to better understand its respective functions and conducted further research into more testing methods and syntax along with much trial-and-error.
Next week:
	- Continue working on the unit-tests.
	- Work on debugging the algorithm.
