Ariel:
This week: 
          - Finished functions for many different types of chessboards (very open ones with different 		
	    amounts of pawns different spaces in between pawns etc.
	  - Tested outputs with the switch team and made fixes to errors.
	  - Formatted the output to fit exactly the input to the switch team ai
	  - Finished testing the generator and work with the switch team for final edits.
Next week:
	  - Start making test functions for different teams such as the algorithm team
	  - Work with the switch team if new types of positions need to be made

Etienne:
This Week:
	- Transitioned to the algorithm / unit-test team. 
	- Conducted further research into the existing chessboard implementation and its respective functions and how these worked with meetings with the team, and how to implement said unit-tests.
	- Created the unit-test files and framework, worked on unit-tests. 
Next Week:
	- Finish the unit tests and move onto debugging the CFBoard implementation.
	- Continue working with the algorithms team and delve into more research for more optimal implementations.
