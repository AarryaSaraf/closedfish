Ariel:
This week: 
          - Finished the implementation of the generator algorithm for one closed position and
            created to match the output required for the switch team using a vector of vectors
	  - Created new functions to make the usage of the Class Chessboard easier.
	  - Started on the file generator for many closed positions
Next week:
	  - Finish making the file generator for many closed positions (using as input the amount of 
            needed closed positions
	  - Finish testing the generator and work with the switch team for final edits.
 	  - See during the lecture what the next tasks will be

Sirawit:
	This week:
		- Use logger to inject stockfish
		- Configured doxygen hosting
		- Configured CD to check compilation on PR
	Next week:
		- [Urgent] Finish stockfish

Shirelle: 
	This week: 
	        - created a function for square color of the pions
		- worked on my function 
	Next week: 
		- find a solution for bishops to be on diagonals in the function completion
		-create function to verify if the king is in check

Aarrya:
	This week: 
		- Finished the 1 person DFS algorithm 
		- made plans and dsitributed work for next weeks
	Next week:
		- merge all algorithms till now into one.
		- finalise work for everyone
		
		
Antonia:
	This week:
		-debugged all the functions involved in giving the number of pieces protecting the target pawn
	Next week:
		-implement a function that tells if the pawn is passed
		-implement a function that tells for each piece if it can or not protect tge target pawn

Etienne: 
This week:
 ⁃ I finished debugging and testing the generator project.
 ⁃ Helped team finish their respective functions.
 ⁃ Started my switch to the algorithm team which requires a lot of research and catching up to the current team knowledge and code.

Next Week:
 ⁃ Continue my research into the algorithm and understand the process / methodology used by the team.
 ⁃ Start implementing unit tests for the existing functions in the algorithm.


Ba Cong:
	This week: 
		- Finished the heat map implementation 
		- Tested the implementation on hand-generated test cases
	Next week:
		- Work with Razvan on finding the least amount of turns to go from one position to another position
		- Try tweaking coefficients in the current heat map implementation to see find a better result
