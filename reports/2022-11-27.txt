Progress report Week 1 Dimitrije Zdrale:
1) (TD) Installed OpenCV after some issues, implemented test function to open image from file.
2) (At home) Wrote a program that opens a given image and finds the chess board, with a class storing each square of the board separately with coordinates on the screen. Everything was done using color recognition in the HVS basis. Classes are to be edited when merging with code that takes a screenshot.
